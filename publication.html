                    <p><em>PhD in <strong>Science</strong>.</em></p>
                    <p>I am a chemist holding a Ph.D. in Science and a very
                        comprehensive toolbox operational either in academia or
                        industry. Since my Ph.D. work up to my current position
                        as a scientist in Kimberly-Clark, I have been a heavy
                        user of Python programming language and ImageJ as tools
                        for data analysis and modeling in a virtual approach
                        within the scientific problem-solving and industry
                        innovation context. I have been working in
                        international groups interested in several different
                        subjects for more than 10 years, easily integrating and
                        quickly adapting myself to new groups of people as well
                        as new working subjects.</p>
